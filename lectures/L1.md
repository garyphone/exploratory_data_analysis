# Week 1

## Lesson 1: Graphs

### Principles of Analytic Graphics

* Principle 1: Show comparisons

	* Evidence for a hypothesis is always *relative* to another competing hypothesis
	
	* Always ask "Compared to What?"

* Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

	* What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
	
* Principle 3: Show multivariate data

	* Multivariate = more than 2 variables
	
	* The real world is multivariate

* Principle 4: Integration of evidence

	* Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
	
	* Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
	
	* Do not let the tool drive the analysis
	
* Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

	* A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
	
* Principle 6: Content is king

	* Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity
	of their content
	
### Exploratory Graphs
	
**Why do we use graphs in data analysis?**

* To understand data properties

* To find patterns in data

* To suggest modeling strategies

* To "debug" analyses

* To communicate results

**Characteristics of exploratory graphs**

* They are made quickly

* A large number are made

* The goal is for personal understanding

* Axex/legends are generally cleaned up

* Color/size are primarily used for information

**Summary**	

* Exploratory plots are "quick and dirty"

* Let you summarize the data (usually graphically) and highly any broad features

* Explore basic questions and hypotheses (and perhaps rule them out)

* Suggest modeling strategies for the "next step"

## Lesson 2: Plotting

### Plotting Systems in R

**The Base Plotting System**

* "Artist's palette" model

* Start with blank canvas and build up from there

* Start with plot function (or similar)

* Use annotation functions to add/modify (`text`, `lines`, `points`, `axis`)

* Convenient, mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data

* Can't go back once plot has started (i.e. to adjust margins); need to plan in advance

* Difficult to "translate" to others once a new plot has been created (no graphical "language")

* Plot is just a series of R commands

**Base Plot**

```
library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))
```

**The Lattice System**

* Plots are created with a single function call (`xyplot`, `bwplot`, etc.)

* Most useful for conditioning types of plots: Looking at how y changes with x across levels of z

* Things like margins/spacing set automatically because entire plot is specified at once

* Good for putting many many plots on a screen

* Sometimes awkward to specify an entire plot in a single function call

* Annotation in plot is not especially intuitive

* Use of panel functions and subscripts difficult to wield and requires intense preparation

* Cannot "add" to the plot once it is created

**Lattice Plot**

```
library(lattice)
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4,1))
```

**The ggplot2 System**

* Splits the difference between base and lattice in a number of ways

* Automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also allows you to annotate by "adding" to a plot

* Superficial similarity to lattice but generally easier/more intuitive to use

* Default mode makes many choices for you (but you can still customize to your heart's desire)

**ggplot2 Plot**

```
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
gplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)
```

**Summary**

* Base: "artist's palette" model

* Lattice: Entire plot specified by one function; conditioning

* ggplot2: Mixes elements of Base and Lattice
	
### Base Plotting System**

**Plotting System**

The core plotting and graphics engine in R is encapsulated in the following packages:

* *graphics*: contains plotting functions for the "base" graphing systems, including `plot`, `hist`, `boxplot`
and many others

* *grDevices*: contains all the code implementing the various graphics devices, including X11, PDF, PostScript, PNG, etc.

The lattice plotting system is implmented using the following packages:

* *lattice*: contains code for producing Trellis graphics, which are independent of the "base" graphics system;
includes functions like `xyplot`, `bwplot`, `levelplot`

* *grid*: implements a different graphing system independent of the "base" system; the *lattice* package builds on top
of *grid*; we seldom call functions from the *grid* package directly

**The Process of Making a Plot**

When making a plt one must first make a few considerations (not necessarily in this order):

* Where will the plot be made? On the screen? In a file?

* How will the plot be used?

	* Is the plot for viewing temporarily on the screen?
		
	* Will it be presented in a web browser?
		
	* Will it eventually end up in a paper that might be printed?
		
	* Are you using it in a presentation?

* Is there a large amount of data going into the plot? Or is it just a few points?

* Do you need to be able to dynamically resize the graphic?

**The Process of Making a Plot**

* What graphics system will you use: base, lattice, or ggplot2? These generally cannot be mixed

* Base graphics are usually constructed piecemeal, with each aspect of the plot handled separately
through a series of function calls; this is often conceptually simpler and allows plotting to mirror
the thought process

* Lattice graphics are usually created in a single function call, so all of the graphics parameters have
to specified at once; specifying everything at once allows R to automatically calculate the necessary spacings
and font sizes

* ggplot2 combines concepts from both base and lattice graphics but used an independent implmentation

We focus on usng the **base plotting system** to create graphics on the **screen device**

**Base Graphics**

Base graphics are used most commonly and are a very powerful system for creating 2-D graphics

* There are two *phases* to creating a base plot

	* Initiallizing a new plot
	
	* Annotating (adding to) an existing plot
	
* Calling `plot(x, y)` or `hist(x)` will launch a graphics device (if one is not already open) and draw a new
plot on the device


* If the arguments to `plot` are not of some special class, then the *default* method for `plot` is called; this function
hs *many* arguments, letting you set the title, x axis label, y axis label, etc.

* The base graphics system has *many* parameters that can set and tweaked; these parameters are documented in `?par`;
it would not hurt to try to memorize this help page

**Simple Base Graphics: Histogram**

```
library(datasets)
hist(airquality$Ozone) ## Draw a new plot
```

**Simple Base Graphics: Boxplot**

```
library(datasets)
airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone (ppb)")
```

**Some Important Base Graphics Parameter**

Many base plotting functions share a set of parameters. Here are a few key ones:

* `pch`: the plotting symbol (default is open circle)

* `lty`: the line type (default is solid line), can be dashed, dotted, etc.

* `lwd`: the line width, specified as an integer multiple

* `col`: the plotting color, specified as a number, string, or hex code; the `colors()` function
gives you a vector of colors by name

* `xlab`: character string for the x-axis label

* `ylab`: character string for the y-axis label

The `par()` function is used to specify *global* graphics parameters that affect all plots in an R session.
These parameters can be overridden when specified as arguments to specific plotting functions.

* `las`: the orientation of the axis labels on the plot

* `bg`: the background color

* `mar`: the margin size

* `oma`: the outer margin size (default is 0 for all sides)

* `mfrow`: number of plots per row, column (plots are filled row-wise)

* `mfcol`: number of plots per row, column (plots are filled column-wise)

**Base Plotting Functions**

* `plot`: make a scatterplot, or other type of plot depending on the class of the object being plotted

* `lines`: add lines to a plot, given a vetor x values and a corresponding vector of y values (or a 2-column matrix);
this function just connects the dots

* `points`: add points to a plot

* `text`: add text labels to a plot using specified x, y coordinates

* `title`: add annotations to x, y axis labels, title, subtitle, outer margin

* `mtext`: add arbitrary text to the margins (inner or outer) of the plot

* `axis`: adding axis ticks/labels

**Base Plot with Annotation**

```
library(datasets)
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))
title(main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City") ## Add a title
```

**Summary**

* Plots in the base plotting system are created by calling successive R functions to "build up" a plot

* Plotting occurs in two stages:

	* Creation of a plot
	
	* Annotation of a plot (adding lines, points, text, legends)
	
* The base plotting system is very flexible and offers a high degree of control over plotting
