# Week 1

## Lesson 1: Graphs

### Principles of Analytic Graphics

* Principle 1: Show comparisons

	* Evidence for a hypothesis is always *relative* to another competing hypothesis
	
	* Always ask "Compared to What?"

* Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

	* What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
	
* Principle 3: Show multivariate data

	* Multivariate = more than 2 variables
	
	* The real world is multivariate

* Principle 4: Integration of evidence

	* Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
	
	* Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
	
	* Do not let the tool drive the analysis
	
* Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

	* A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
	
* Principle 6: Content is king

	* Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity
	of their content
	
### Exploratory Graphs
	
**Why do we use graphs in data analysis?**

* To understand data properties

* To find patterns in data

* To suggest modeling strategies

* To "debug" analyses

* To communicate results

**Characteristics of exploratory graphs**

* They are made quickly

* A large number are made

* The goal is for personal understanding

* Axex/legends are generally cleaned up

* Color/size are primarily used for information

**Summary**	

* Exploratory plots are "quick and dirty"

* Let you summarize the data (usually graphically) and highly any broad features

* Explore basic questions and hypotheses (and perhaps rule them out)

* Suggest modeling strategies for the "next step"

## Lesson 2: Plotting

### Plotting Systems in R

**The Base Plotting System**

* "Artist's palette" model

* Start with blank canvas and build up from there

* Start with plot function (or similar)

* Use annotation functions to add/modify (`text`, `lines`, `points`, `axis`)

* Convenient, mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data

* Can't go back once plot has started (i.e. to adjust margins); need to plan in advance

* Difficult to "translate" to others once a new plot has been created (no graphical "language")

* Plot is just a series of R commands

**Base Plot**

```
library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))
```

**The Lattice System**

* Plots are created with a single function call (`xyplot`, `bwplot`, etc.)

* Most useful for conditioning types of plots: Looking at how y changes with x across levels of z

* Things like margins/spacing set automatically because entire plot is specified at once

* Good for putting many many plots on a screen

* Sometimes awkward to specify an entire plot in a single function call

* Annotation in plot is not especially intuitive

* Use of panel functions and subscripts difficult to wield and requires intense preparation

* Cannot "add" to the plot once it is created

**Lattice Plot**

```
library(lattice)
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4,1))
```

**The ggplot2 System**

* Splits the difference between base and lattice in a number of ways

* Automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also allows you to annotate by "adding" to a plot

* Superficial similarity to lattice but generally easier/more intuitive to use

* Default mode makes many choices for you (but you can still customize to your heart's desire)

**ggplot2 Plot**

```
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
gplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)
```

**Summary**

* Base: "artist's palette" model

* Lattice: Entire plot specified by one function; conditioning

* ggplot2: Mixes elements of Base and Lattice
