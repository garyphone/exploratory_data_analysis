# Week 1

## Lesson 1: Graphs

**Principles of Analytic Graphics**

* Principle 1: Show comparisons

	* Evidence for a hypothesis is always *relative* to another competing hypothesis
	
	* Always ask "Compared to What?"

* Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

	* What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
	
* Principle 3: Show multivariate data

	* Multivariate = more than 2 variables
	
	* The real world is multivariate

* Principle 4: Integration of evidence

	* Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
	
	* Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
	
	* Do not let the tool drive the analysis
	
* Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

	* A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
	
* Principle 6: Content is king

	* Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity
	of their content
